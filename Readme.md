REST 

In Spring Boot, REST (Representational State Transfer) refers to a style 
of architecture used to build web services that allow applications to communicate
over HTTP by exchanging data in a stateless manner. RESTful services in Spring Boot
are built using Spring's REST support, primarily through @RestController, and they
allow data to be requested and manipulated through standardized HTTP methods such 
as GET, POST, PUT, and DELETE.
